People are strange. If you start by stating the good, before the bad, overall they'll be happier than if you said all the same words but put the bad first.

Similar words with different nuances give different tones and have big effects. And, "that's just semantics" is true, but semantics are really important, without clarity on our words' definitions we are unable to communicate at all!

I like communication because its an example of applied-philosophy. Which words you use makes a big difference (and pragmatics shows that using words can have social effect e.g. silencing, self-fulfilling prophecies). So, if we invest into careful insight and planning (i.e. theorycraft and do Philosophy), we can make a positive social change!
