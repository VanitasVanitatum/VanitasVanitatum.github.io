Many gross topics are typically overlooked or rationalized as respectable, because their twisted reality hasn't been exposed e.g. pornography, abortion, capitalism. Once we see that corruption in others, let's not deny that it lures us too. Yeah it's dark and gross to look at them, but this is the reality of The World that many other people are drowning in. I'm here to dare to show a different way.
