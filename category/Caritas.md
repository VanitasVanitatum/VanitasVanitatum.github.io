'Caritas', Latin for 'Agape', which is self-saccrificial love, of parent for child, God for us. These posts are the discipleship equivalent of self-help. How we approach other people mirrors how we approach ourself. If we are to love our neighbor as we love ourselves, let's become self-aware and love ourselves in a way that challenges us to grow and be purified. [Lev tahor b'ra li Elohim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpHy77S-ITs).
