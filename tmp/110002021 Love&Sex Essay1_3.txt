self-interested erotic desire
	= desiring the erotic pleasure of oneself
	MY desire for THEM to have sex with me
	my pleasure makes me happy
	self-interested erotic desire is morally problematic for Kant, because it involves wanting to interact with THEM in a way that will give ME pleasure. I am at risk of treating THEM as a means-to-an-ends for MY pleasure.
 	is only directed at romantic partners

other-interested erotic desire
	= desiring the erotic pleasure of another
	MY desire for THEM to have sex with NOT-me
	can be directed at romantic partners, but also at friends, parents, even one's (adult) children
	your pleasure makes me happy
