Guide for Spellcraft_Open_Remastered_5.6.8.w3x
For this document to display properly you need to use a monospace font like Consolas.

Combine elements to make any spell layout you want! Pick your preferred playstyle then look carefully heroes' stats to find a good fit.
	Hardest to kill are heroes with low intelligence and high strength. Make them tank and give them spells that cost no mana (Passives Auras).
	Easier to kill are heroes with more intelligence but still have enough strength. Focus on fighting and give them spells that cost little mana (Buffs Damage-Nearby Interrupts).
	Easiest to kill are heroes with tons of intelligence and little strength. Give them spells that cost tons of mana and focus on support (Heals Damage Summons Interrupts).
	Summons are good for tanking damage. Damage aoe is better for clearing creeps, stacking Interrupts is best for killing heroes.

Recommended heroes:
	At first it seems like 'the higher the int the better' but this isn't true. If you're only int focused you scale past your mana usage pretty soon, and die too easily. Plus, because all the int heroes have been nerfed into being agi based, int doesn't scale your dmg output. Thus I prefer int in the 26-29 range. I've sorted these reccomendations from lower-to-higher int.
	Melee Tanks: Warbreed (29/23/13 str), Naga Big Brother (31/19/15 str), Dwarf Elite (28/20/17 str), Dead Knight (28/17/20 str), and Tauren Chieftan (28/15/22 str).
	Ranged Damage: Beserk Masta (22/27/16 agi), Gunslinger (18/26/21 agi), Dark Ranger (16/25/24 agi), Dryad (14/24/27 agi), Dryad Enchantress (13/24/28 agi), and Shadow Hunter (15/22/28 agi).
	High str and high int: Ogre Magi (25/12/28 str melee), King (22/12/31 str melee).

Here are the element codes:

Sorting by elements then function
	In Race mode 2 random elements will get a 25% discount. This gives 3-for-the-price-of-4 which is a big deal! If you have a discount for (e.g.) E and Y search in this list under the EE? YY? and EY? headings.
	This list isn't alphabetical, it follows the pattern of how the elements are listed in the store: WESDFLYTX. E comes before Y hence 'EY?' but not 'YE?'.
