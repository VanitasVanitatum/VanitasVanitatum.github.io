Oldschool RTS are great, but thier input schemes usually aren't. Technically you shouldn't use these for multiplayer, to not have any unfair advantange. (Though as I saw it, if I put in the effort to learn to code AHK, and to fine-tune the script ... then I should be allowed to use them when I want.)
