Sorry the '3' isn't about confessions i.e. Protestant vs. Catholic vs. Orthodox. Those are important and interesting differences to discuss (namely Filioque and Apostolic Succession), but that's study that still lies before me.

The '3' is about Christian diversity representation, and (rightly) feeling wronged if you don't fit into one of these boxes:

### Hollow Hoaxers  
Religion is traditional culture. A curiosity belonging in a museum, for refined and subtle tastes.  
Religion is upper-class power. A precursor to the 'Charity Fundraiser' social bubble and benefits of rubbing shoulders with high-society.  
Religion is for old people. It isn't transformative, living, vibrant, inspiring, and active. It's sterile.  

### Heated Haters  
Religion is traditional values. As filtered through the mouth of its preacher, who may-or-may-not skew the message for his own benefit. Come back again to get your reward, *he sure will*.  
Religion is lower-class identity. You'd better believe what the man taught, 'cause that's The Good Book's truth. Obey him too.  
Religion is for self-righteously 'good' people. It's for the right people, so if you're not a church-goer, you're the wrong people, riff-raff.  

### Homley Hipsters  
Religion is a hypebeast. Rustic, flannel, coffe, handwritten fonts, hashtags. Starry skies with bible verses, baking, bunting, bowties.  
Religion is woke, modestly. Vegetarianism, ethical fashion, carpooling, diversity. So *in* the world and forward, #relevant.  
Religion is a concert. Dramatic prayers and and droves of fans, conversion on tap. Flashing lights and crashing bands, pumping electricity.  

These are gross stereotypes. That's the point. Stereotypes are gross. They leave no room for nuance, subtelty, uniqueness. I shudder writing something edgy and opinionated, without putting in lots of caveats and apologies. Without making double- and triple- sure to pre-empt and diffuse any offense I might cause.
