Sorry the '3' isn't about confessions i.e. Protestant vs. Catholic vs. Orthodox. Those are important and interesting differences to discuss (namely Filioque and Apostolic Succession), but that's study that still lies before me.

The '3' is about Christian diversity representation, and (rightly) feeling wronged if you don't fit into one of these boxes:

### Hollow Hoaxers  
**Religion is traditional culture.** A curiosity belonging in a museum, for refined and subtle tastes.  
**Religion is upper-class power.** A precursor to the 'Charity Fundraiser' social bubble and benefits of rubbing shoulders with high-society.  
**Religion is for old people.** It isn't transformative, living, vibrant, inspiring, and active. It's sterile.  

### Heated Haters  
**Religion is traditional values.** As filtered through the mouth of its preacher, who may-or-may-not skew the message for his own benefit. Come back again to get your reward, *he sure will*.  
**Religion is lower-class identity.** You'd better believe what the man taught, 'cause that's The Good Book's truth. Obey him too.  
**Religion is for self-righteously 'good' people.** It's for the right people, so if you're not a church-goer, you're the wrong people, riff-raff.  

### Homley Hipsters  
**Religion is a hypebeast.** Rustic, flannel, coffee, handwritten fonts, hashtags. Starry skies with bible verses, baking, bunting, bow-ties.  
**Religion is woke, modestly.** Vegetarianism, ethical fashion, carpooling, diversity. So *in* the world and forward, #relevant.  
**Religion is a concert.** Dramatic prayers and and droves of fans, conversion on tap. Flashing lights and crashing bands, pumping electricity.  

I shudder when writing something this edgy and opinionated, without putting in lots of caveats and apologies. Without making double- and triple- sure to preempt and diffuse any offense I might cause. I'm depicting a negative attitude that I don't endorse. The negative attitude is stereotyping. My call is for you to not let these stereotypes be true.

#### Don't apply these stereotypes to other people.
They're harsh and gross, which is why I'm naming-and-shaming them. We need to anticipate that people will be full of nuance, subtlety, contradiction, and uniqueness (e.g. dressing-up like a hipster, being lower-class, but enjoying high-church).

Don't approach other people, especially not Christian brothers, with this sort of bitterness and judgmentalism. Give them a chance. You may have dis-taste for their (lack of) cultural relevance/taste, but don't permit that take root and poison your heart, building a barrier stopping you from treating them with dignity.

#### Don't apply these stereotypes to yourself.
Don't base your Christian identity on social group conformity. (Our identity is in Christ)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7W4I0tQZps&t=0s&list=PLqLno2B-jEzbqT7hPT2R7Th-RQfeM9b99&index=13], not in our music style, social class, style of dress, or oppulence of church building.
