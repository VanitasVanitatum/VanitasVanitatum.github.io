Download and use my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Default%20(Windows).sublime-keymap">Settings for Sublime Text 3</a>.

This file goes into your (Sublime Text Directory)/Data/Packages/User folder. Don't overwrite your own settings, open this up and take what you like.

You'll need to get your own copy the best Monospace Unicode font in existence, <a href="https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/">PragmataPro</a>.
