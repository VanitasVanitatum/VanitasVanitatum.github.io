Stop fixating if you see these signs:

Information: You can't see your own ignorance because you are blinded by your feelings, or you havetoo little evidence to make an informed judgement.

Understanding: You haven't defined both an *aim* and an *end* to your thinking, a *question* and a *stopping-point*.

Willpower: You complain to yourself, or accuse yourself, about reality and what you *could* have done. You want to act but feel blocked.

Quit tormenting yourself on a path with no closure. Don't be afriad to admit your limitations. Pause the battle until you can return with reinforcements.

Regain your strength:
Emotionally Stabalize: eat, rest, pray, hope
Share: the burden by seeking outside help (advice, listening service).
Resolve: on a provisional plan for what you still *can* do.
