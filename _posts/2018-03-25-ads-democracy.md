> "It's one thing for a pile of data to be gathered about me or you and crunched [to send us ads] designed to persuade us to buy [stuff]. It's quite another when it can potentially shift election results."
> "[Micro-targeting] cuts out the noise of all the alternative viewpoints that would otherwise complicate a person's political decision-making" oh dear

Here's an excellent profile-piece of a man who gets paid to buy people's private data, to target them for propaganda.

It's ironic that this global-scale privacy-violator is himself very reluctant to reveal any details from his personal life. It was touching to read how, after Eton, he studied Art History because ""It was something that I always have been incredibly passionate about"" So, not a "Math Man" after all.
However,
>"I just thought this was the last opportunity to study something that I cared about. I was pretty adamant I'd go into finance."
It's disgraceful to mislead people into surrendering their data, then using this data to maximise how manipulative your ads are to said people.

> 23:15 How did you get the emotional profile of people? "There's no reason why people should give up any data at all, and there's certainly no obligation to. We managed to collect millions — hundres of thousands — or millions I should say, of emotional profiles in the US by people volounteering this information to us. We can then match these emotional profiles against the data attributes that we hold on those individuals who have taken these personality inventories."
> 25:00 "They're voluntarily giving up their data, they're doing this in full knowledge of what's happening here, this is not anything Machiavellian or out-of-order.
This is a lie. The US data-set Cambridge Analytica used was largley harvested without consent, using an exploit that, if one person volounteered themselves through a survey, the rest of their entire friends-list would be scraped as well. https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election

Nix defends Trump's election as "free and fair ... the will of the people" after having spent 20 minutes taking credit for manipulating people into voting for Trump.
Can ANY advertising exec say in good conscience that their adverts exist to provide "fair representation" of their product? The very act of targeting the delivery to exploit people's specific personality faults is coercive.
Back to the Article:
> "[Nix] doesn't resile from Cambridge Analytica's contribution to the Trump campaign. "We're a service provider and we're just trying to provide the best possible service for our clients."
Nix acts like a respectable professional, but he's really just a mercenary, willing to exploit people's data for the highest bidder.
