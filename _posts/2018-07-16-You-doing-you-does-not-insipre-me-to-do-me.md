"I just wanna thank you for being you. I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hugs] yay me."

'The Incredibles 2' (2018) 


'You doing *me*' will 'Inspire me to do me'

Representations of diversity are only inspiring if what's represented is relatable.



a representation of diversity inspires me → that representation is relatable

inspiring → relatable
¬relatable → ¬inspiring


All inspiring things are relatable.
Not all relatable things are inspiring.
If something is not relatable, then it cannot be inspiring.
