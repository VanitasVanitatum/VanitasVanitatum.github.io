"Oh wow, WOW, Elastagirl there you are ... Hi, my superhero name is Voyd, I just wanna thank you for being you! I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hug] yay me!"

The simple reading of this scene from "The Incredibles 2" (2018) is that Elastagirl, by daring to be a public (female) superhero, serves as a role-model for other young (female) superheroes, inspiring them to be themselves. Sure, it's a kids' movie, yay good themes about confidence, growing up, and it's OK to be yourself. <sup><sub>[But it needs to be taken seriously, because it has a massive audience while being very forward with its politics. For the record, overall I think the film and Voyd's contribution are valuable and positive, though a bit cliché.]</sub></sup>

Here's the problem — diversity is in conflict with representation, how we talk about them doesn't match how representation actually works. And if what we say doesn't match what we actually believe, everyone gets mislead (including ourselves), so let's be clear here.

Voyd embodies diversity, being minority (superhero), female, likely queer (half-shaved dyed hair, masculine jaw), and speaking impeccable pop politics. 

Elastagirl embodies representation, being minority (superhero), female, and bold enough to live openly as a superhero in a society that oppresses them. It isn't stated explicitly, but the fact that Elastagirl is a superhero *and female* doubles her relatability for Voyd. <sup><sub>[Inverting the gender roles from "The Incredibles" (2004) was cool and good, making all the male characters easily duped wasn't.]</sub></sup>

**'Diversity is Inspiring'**: Voyd says 'You doing *you*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Other people being themselves inspires me to be myself. Yay representation and diversity, our differences empower everyone.  
**'Representation is Inspiring'**: Voyd means 'You doing *me*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Elastagirl is only a role-model insofar as Voyd can relate to her. That's because:

**Representations of diversity can only inspiring when they're is relatable.** <sup><sub>[Logic:  
I→R  If someone is inspiring, then they must be relatable.  
¬R→¬I If someone is not relatable, then they cannot be inspiring.]</sub></sup>

Here's how role-models actually work: someone performing-the-role only inspires you to have confidence that you can also perform-*that*-role, if they're sufficiently similar to you that you can realistically imagine yourself in their role.
For example, plenty of 2016 presidential hopefuls were authentically 'you doing you', but the biggest (token) role-model for young girls was Hillary Clinton, not because of 'you do you' (her being a lawyer, former secretary of state, or having already lived in the White House), but simply because she's a woman.

<sup><sub>[For another post, is the obvious tokenism problem here, that focus of pop-diversity-representation is too narrow, focusing more on traits which are outside people's control (sex/ethnicity), rather than things everyone can make an effort to improve (confidence/moral integrity). Also thinking that identity is 'merely a deliberate performance' is trendy, but is a very flawed ontology of personhood.]</sub></sup>


If what Voyd says (what I called 'Diversity is Inspiring') was true, seeing people who are different from herself would inspire "yay me".
The fact is, Voyd only feels welcomed among her own people (superheroes).
She clearly *isn't* inspired by un-relatable normie non-superheros 'doing you' (doing their normality) — they make her feel "like an outcast".

Therefore what Voyd says ('Diversity is Inspiring') **is false**, 'You doing *you*' does NOT 'inspire me to do me' when applied to the vast majority of people. <sup><sub>Hence this post's title.</sub></sup> Diversity itself isn't enough to inspire other people to confidently be themselves.

So how *do* we inspire people to be confident and dignified? Being relatable is a start. If you're too garishly obstinate, and base your identity on being proud to stand out, you pre-filter. The only people who'll get past your defenses are those who are already as outlandish as you. <sup><sub>[This deserves its own post]</sub></sup>

Unfortunately even 'Representation is Inspiring' isn't guaranteed to be true, someone can be relatable without being inspiring.
If our focus is too narrow (only on the diverse differences), that will prevent us from relating to a potential role-model.
<sup><sub>[Logically we only have I→R, not I⇔R, so the entailment backwards R→I doesn't hold.]</sub></sup>

A pro athlete may be 'doing me' (e.g. has the same sex/ethnicity as me), but if I only focus on the differences between us (e.g. how much better they are at sport), I'll be daunted and feel they're un-relatable, their prowess unattainable. There is some common ground, there's a *potential* to relate, but it takes some extra effort to *actually* relate.

**We need to deliberately focus on what we have in common,** rather than defining ourselves by our differences. When reconciling different groups (e.g. the French and the British) let's focus on what we have in common (e.g. both loving cheese) and the places where the channel dividing us is narrowest (the best places to build a bridge e.g. Calais and Dover), rather than how far-apart are our capitols (e.g. Paris and London).

Pop politics says 'Diversity unities us', but this is deluded. Defining ourselves according to our diversity
