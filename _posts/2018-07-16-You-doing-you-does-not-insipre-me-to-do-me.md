"Oh wow, WOW, Elastagirl there you are ... Hi, my superhero name is Voyd, I just wanna thank you for being you! I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hug] yay me!"

The simple reading of this scene from "The Incredibles 2" (2018) is that Elastagirl, by daring to be a public (female) superhero, serves as a role-model for other young (female) superheroes, inspiring them to be themselves. Sure, it's a kids' movie, yadda yadda good themes about confidence and growing up. <sup><sub>[But it needs to be taken seriously, because it has a massive audience while being very forward in its politics. For the record, overall I think the film and Voyd's contribution are valuable and positive, though a bit cliché.]</sub></sup>

Here's the problem — diversity is in conflict with representation, how we talk about them doesn't match how representation actually works. If what we say doesn't match what we actually believe, everyone gets mislead (including ourselves), so let's be clear here.

Voyd embodies diversity, being minority (superhero), female, likely queer (half-shaved dyed hair, masculine jaw), and speaking impeccable pop politics. 

Elastagirl embodies representation, being minority (superhero), female, and bold enough to live openly as a superhero in a society that oppresses them. It isn't stated explicitly, but the fact that Elastagirl is a superhero AND FEMALE doubles her relatability for Voyd. <sup><sub>[Inverting the gender roles from "The Incredibles" (2004) was cool and good, making all the male characters easily duped wasn't.]</sub></sup>

**Diversity is Inspiring**, what Voyd says: 'You doing *you*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Other people being themselves inspires me to be myself. Yay representation and diversity, they empower everyone.  
**Representation is Inspiring**, what Voyd means: 'You doing *me*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Elastagirl is only a role-model insofar as Voyd can relate to her. That's because:

**Representations of diversity can only inspiring when they're is relatable.**  
<sup><sub>[Logic:  
I→R  If someone is inspiring, then they must be relatable.  
¬R→¬I If someone is not relatable, then they cannot be inspiring.]</sub></sup>

Here's how role-models actually work: someone performing-the-role inspires you to have confidence that you can also perform-*that*-role.
Someone's only a role-model if they're sufficently similar to you that you can realistically imagine yourself in their role.
Plenty of 2016 presidential hopefuls were authentically 'you doing you', but the biggest (token) role-model for young girls was Hillary Clinton, not because of 'you do you', but more because she's a woman.

<sup><sub>[To discuss later is the obvious tokenism problem here, that mainstream diversity representation's focus is too narrow, focusing more on traits which are outside people's control (sex/ethnicity), rather than things everyone can make an effort to improve (confidence/moral integrity).]</sub></sup>


If what Voyd says (what I called 'Diversity is Inspirational') is true, seeing people who are different from herself would inspire her to be be a self-confident superhero herself.
The fact is, Voyd only feels welcomed among her own people (superheroes).
She clearly *isn't* inspired by unrelatable normie non-superheros 'doing you' (doing their normality) — they make her feel "like an Outcast".

Therefore what Voyd says ('Diversity is Inspiring') isn't true, 'You doing *you*' does NOT 'inspire me to do me'. <sup><sub>Hence this post's title.</sub></sup> Mere diversity by itself isn't enough to inspire other people to confidently be themselves.

So how *do* we inspire people to be confident and dignified? Being relatable is a start. If you're too garishly obstinate, and base your identity on being proud to stand out, the only people who'll get past your defenses are those as outlandish as you.


But our interpretation also matters. Someone being relatable is only the groundwork, by itself that's insufficent to be inspiring. Rather than being daunted

Let's presume anyone with the same race/gender/nationality as me is 'relatable', because I 
<sup><sub>[Logically we only have I→R, not I⇔R, so the entailment doesn't go backwards as in R→I.]</sub></sup>

Not defining ourselves by our differences, but by what we have in common. Focusing on the places where the channel dividing us is narrowest (a good place to build a bridge), rather than how far-apart our capitols are.


Pop politics says 'Diversity unities us', but this is deluded. Defining ourselves according to our diversity


Instead we should
