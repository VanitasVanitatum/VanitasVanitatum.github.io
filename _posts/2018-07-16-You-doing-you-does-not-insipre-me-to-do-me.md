"Oh wow, WOW, Elastagirl there you are ... Hi, my superhero name is Voyd, I just wanna thank you for being you! I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hug] yay me!"

The simple reading of this scene from "The Incredibles 2" (2018) is that Elastagirl, by daring to be a public (female) superhero, serves as a role-model for other young (female) superheroes, inspiring them to be themselves. Sure, it's a kid's movie, good themes about confidence and growing up. [For the record overall I think Voyd's contribution is valuable and positive, though a bit cliché.]

But there's a problem — there's a mismatch between what's said and what's meant. How we talk about representation doesn't match how representation actually works. If what we say doesn't match what we actually believe, everyone gets mislead (including ourselves), so let's be clear here.

Voyd represents diversity, being female, likely queer (half-shaved dyed hair, masculine jaw), minority (superhero), and speaking impeccable pop politics.  
Voyd the mouthpiece says: 'You doing *you*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Other people being themselves inspires me to be myself. Yay representation and diversity, they empower everyone.  
But what Voyd really means is: 'You doing *me*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Elastagirl is only a role-model insofar as Voyd can relate to her.

**Representations of diversity are only inspiring, if what's represented is relatable.** Someone's only a role-model if they're sufficently similar to you that you can actually imagine yourself in their role. Them performing-the-role inspires you to have confidence that you can also perform-that-role. It isn't stated explicitly, but the fact that Elastagirl is a superhero AND FEMALE doubles her relatability for Voyd.

The fact that Voyd only feels welcomed among her own people (superheroes) shows she fee.
Voyd seeing people who are different from herself doesn't inspire her to be herself, it makes her feel isolated.

Voyd clearly *isn't* inspired to be a self-confident superhero, by unrelatable normal non-superheros 'doing you' (doing their normality) — they make her feel "like an Outcast".  
Mere representation and diversity by themselves aren't enough to inspire

[Logic  
I→R  If someone is inspiring, they must be relatable.  
¬R→¬I If someone is not relatable, then they cannot be inspiring.]


So how *do* we inspire people to be confident and dignified? Being relatable is a start. If you're too garishly obstinate, and base your identity on being proud to stand out, the only people who'll get past your defenses are those as outlandish as you.


But our interpreation also matters. Someone being relatable is only the groundwork, by itself that's insufficent to be inspiring. Rather than being daunted

Let's presume anyone with the same race/gender/nationality as me is 'relatable', because I 
[Logically we only have I→R, not I⇔R, so the entailment doesn't go backwards as in R→I.] 

Not defining ourselves by our differences, but by what we have in common. Focusing on the places where the channel dividing us is narrowest (a good place to build a bridge), rather than how far-apart our capitols are.


Pop politics says 'Diversity unities us', but this is deluded. Defining ourselves according to our diversity


Instead we should
