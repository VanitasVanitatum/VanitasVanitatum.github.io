"Oh wow, WOW, Elastagirl there you are ... Hi, my superhero name is Voyd, I just wanna thank you for being you! I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hug] yay me!"

The simple reading of this scene from "The Incredibles 2" (2018) is that Elastagirl, by daring to be a public (female) superhero, serves as a role-model for other young (female) superheroes, inspiring them to be themselves. Sure, it's a kid's movie, good themes about confidence and growing up.

But there's a problem — the mismatch between what's said and what's meant. How we talk about representation doesn't match how representation actually works. If what we say doesn't match what we actually believe, everyone gets mislead (including ourselves), so let's be clear here.

Voyd is clearly the 'voice of diversity', being female, likely queer (half-shaved dyed hair, masculine jaw), and speaking impeccable pop politics.
Voyd the mouthpiece says: 'You doing you' will 'inspire me to do me'. Other people being themselves inspires me to be myself. Yay representation and diversity, they empower everyone.
But what Voyd really means is: 'You doing *me*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Elastagirl is only a role-model insofar as Voyd can relate to her.

Representations of diversity are only inspiring, if what's represented is relatable.

Being inspiring is necessairy for things to be relatable.
 I→R  If something is inspiring, it must be relatable.
¬R→¬I If something is not relatable, then it cannot be inspiring.

Voyd clearly *isn't* inspired by unrelatable people (say, non-female, non-superheros). Therefore her advice fails.
Normal people 'doing you' (doing their normality) doesn't inspire Voyd, it makes her feel "like an Outcast".

Voyd's differences isolate her, they don't inspire her. She only feels welcomed once she's amongst her own people, superheroes.



So how *do* we inspire people to be confident and dignified? Being relatable is a start.



But being relatable itself isn't enough to be inspiring.
Instead we should 

'Diversity unities us' is deluded.
