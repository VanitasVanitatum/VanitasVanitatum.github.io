"Oh wow, WOW, Elastagirl there you are ... Hi, my superhero name is Voyd, I just wanna thank you for being you! I felt like an outcast, before. But now with *you* being *you*, I feel like [hug] yay me!"

The simple reading of this scene from "The Incredibles 2" (2018) is that Elastagirl, by daring to be a public (female) superhero, serves as a role-model for other young (female) superheroes, inspiring them to be themselves. Sure, it's a kid's movie, good themes about confidence and growing up.

But there's a problem — the mismatch between what's said and what's meant. How we talk about representation doesn't match how representation actually works. If what we say doesn't match what we actually believe, everyone gets mislead (including ourselves), so let's be clear here.

Voyd serves as the voice of diversity, being female, likely queer (half-shaved dyed hair, masculine jaw), and speaking impeccable pop politics.  
Voyd the mouthpiece says: 'You doing you' will 'inspire me to do me'. Other people being themselves inspires me to be myself. Yay representation and diversity, they empower everyone.  
But what Voyd really means is: 'You doing *me*' will 'inspire me to do me'. Elastagirl is only a role-model insofar as Voyd can relate to her.

Representations of diversity are only inspiring, if what's represented is relatable. Someone's only a role-model, if they're sufficently similar to you, that you can imagine yourself in their role.

Being inspiring is necessairy for things to be relatable.  
I→R  If something is inspiring, it must be relatable.  
¬R→¬I If something is not relatable, then it cannot be inspiring.

Voyd clearly *isn't* inspired by unrelatable people (say, non-female, non-superheros).
Therefore her advice fails.
Normal people 'doing you' (doing their normality) doesn't inspire Voyd, it makes her feel "like an Outcast".
Voyd's differences don't inspire her, they isolate her. She only feels welcomed among her own people (superheroes).
Mere representation and diversity by themselves aren't enough to be inspiring.

So how *do* we inspire people to be confident and dignified? Being relatable is a start. If you're too garishly obstinate, and base your identity on being proud to stand out, the only people who'll get past your defenses are those as outlandish as you.

Unfortunately, simply being relatable isn't enough to also be inspiring. [Logically we only have I→R, not I⇔R, so the entailment doesn't go backwards like R→I.]

Not defining ourselves by our differences, but by what we have in common. Focusing on the places where the channel dividing us is narrowest (a good place to build a bridge), rather than how far-apart our capitols are.


Pop politics say 'Diversity unities us', but this is deluded. Defining ourselves according to our diversity


Instead we should
