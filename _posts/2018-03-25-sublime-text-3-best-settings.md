Download and use my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Preferences.sublime-settings">Settings for Sublime Text 3</a>.

This file goes into your (Sublime Text Directory)/Data/Packages/User folder. Don't overwrite your own settings, open this up and take what you like.

You can also <a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/downloads/Preferences.sublime-settings">examine this code on my GitHub</a>.

You'll need to get your own copy the best Monospace Unicode font in existence, <a href="https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/">PragmataPro</a>.
