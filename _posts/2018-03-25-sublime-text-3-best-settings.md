<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Preferences.sublime-settings">Download</a> and use my Settings for Sublime Text 3.

This file goes into your (Sublime Text Directory)/Data/Packages/User folder. Don't overwrite your own settings, open this up and take what you like.

You can also <a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/blob/master/downloads/Preferences.sublime-settings">examine this code</a> on my GitHub.

You'll need to get your own copy the best Monospace Unicode font in existence, <a href="https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/">PragmataPro</a>.
