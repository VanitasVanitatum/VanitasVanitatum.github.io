Animated cover-photo of the car doing it's lateral parking (steps 2. and 5. show the wheels rotating in-place). Can showcase 3 different car variants (mini, city, van).

DropBox is the most user-friendly and widley-adopted filesharing software. BoxCryptor lies on top of DropBox and encrypts the contents. DropBox can't read your stuff, they only store the jumbled files, which are encrypted on either side by Dropbox.

Turning the book into a pay-to-view website is the reverse of blogging. Nowadays bloggers write web posts, then compile them into books which they sell. My idea comes from 'BetterExplained', a math website: https://betterexplained.com/calculus/#pricing He simply collated his free blog posts (with the same graphics and text) into a book, and leveraged his 10-year massive email subscriber-base (450k+) to tell them it was available 'offline' and 'giftable' (smart people often purchase books to give as gifts). His book became an Amazon bestseler even though ALL THE SAME CONTENT was already freely available on his blog. People paid for the convenience of a book. 'Web-first' content's biggest inconvenience is offline unavailability. If you bother to collate the same content into a book, it fixes this problem, and can be up-sold as "available offline".
