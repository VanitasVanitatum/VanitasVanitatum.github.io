> "It's one thing for a pile of data to be gathered about me or you and crunched [to send us ads] designed to persuade us to buy [stuff]. It's quite another when it can potentially shift election results."

> "[Micro-targeting] cuts out the noise of all the alternative viewpoints that would otherwise complicate a person's political decision-making" oh dear

Here's an [excellent profile-piece](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/good-weekend/what-that-facebook-quiz-is-doing-to-your-privacy-20170706-gx5zvj.html) of a man who gets paid to buy people's private data, to target them for propaganda.


It's ironic that this global-scale privacy-violator is himself very reluctant to reveal any details from his personal life. It was touching to read how, after Eton, he studied Art History because "It was something that I always have been incredibly passionate about" So, after all that hype, he's not even a "Math Man" after all.
Nevertheless,

>"I just thought this was the last opportunity to study something that I cared about. I was pretty adamant I'd go into finance."

It's disgraceful to mislead people into surrendering their data, then using this data to maximise how manipulative your ads are to said people.

Check out the barefaced lying in this [Youtube Keynote Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bG5ps5KdDo)

> 23:15 How did you get the emotional profile of people? "There's no reason why people should give up any data at all, and there's certainly no obligation to. We managed to collect millions — hundreds of thousands — or millions I should say, of emotional profiles in the US by people volunteering this information to us. We can then match these emotional profiles against the data attributes that we hold on those individuals who have taken these personality inventories."

> 25:00 "They're voluntarily giving up their data, they're doing this in full knowledge of what's happening here, this is not anything Machiavellian or out-of-order.

This is a lie! The US data-set Cambridge Analytica used was largely harvested without consent, using an exploit that, if one person volunteered themselves through a survey, the rest of their [entire friends-list data](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election) would be scraped as well.

Nix defends Trump's election as "free and fair ... the will of the people" after having spent 20 minutes taking credit for manipulating people into voting for Trump.
Can ANY advertising exec say in good conscience that their adverts exist to provide "fair representation" of their product? The very act of targeting the delivery to exploit people's specific personality faults is coercive.

Back to the Article:
> "[Nix] doesn't [shy] from Cambridge Analytica's contribution to the Trump campaign. "We're a service provider and we're just trying to provide the best possible service for our clients."

Nix acts like a respectable professional, but he's really just a mercenary, willing to exploit people's data for the highest bidder.

Taking a step back, it needn't be all dooms-day. Your data is out there, including psychometric tests and shopping habits (if not even porn habits). But can they REALLY use that already? Surely that'd take too much effort and processing-power. Surely Cambridge Analytica would profit if they exaggerated their effectiveness, so they can't be as powerful as they claim.
We can debate about today's data-hotshots; how nice, nasty, naive, or nefarious they are. That doesn't matter. It's the NEXT round of predatory advertisers who'll buy (or steal) your data that we should be concerned about.
Even if the data can't be abused today, the fact that it's ALREADY out there means we have no way of preventing it from being abused tomorrow.

I want to be able to live a quiet life, where I control "who knows me" and I opt-in to any political choices I make.
That's no longer possible. You can't browse, shop, or communicate online without your clicks and eyeballs being tracked, manipulated, and monetised.

> ""Remember, Google's customers are advertisers, not users," says academic Vanessa Teague. "So the service to Google's customers is that they can get good data about how effective their ads are.""

From now on, I refuse to consent to Google violating my privacy. Recently I was making a new email account.
I've attached Google's current Gmail ToS (dated 2018.03.20). After reading that, I closed the Gmail signup window immediately, and made this account instead Vanitas.V@protonmail.com

The cat's largely already out-of-the-bag, but there are still some basic improvements you can make today.
There exist other, high-quality, free Email providers, beyond Google (e.g. Proton Mail).
Same for Instant Messaging, screw FaceBook (which also includes WhatsApp and Instagram), use Telegram instead!
Consider sacrificing some of the convenience of Google Chrome, to switching to Mozilla (or even TOR) and using a VPN.

The bad news is our default, free, convenient web options are abusive.
The good news is we can still do something about it.
Share this article with your friends, and we can start making privacy (not profit) the priority.
